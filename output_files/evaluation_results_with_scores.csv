How does the import range vary in the later half of the year?
ASSISTANT: ","In the later half of the year, the monthly import range becomes bigger.","The import range of fruit and vegetable juices and frozen fruit in Canada varies significantly in the later half of the year. In January, the import value of fruit and vegetable juices and frozen fruit is at its lowest, with only $10 million worth of products being imported. However, this value gradually increases throughout the year, reaching a peak of $110 million in November. This indicates a gradual increase in the demand for these products in Canada, possibly due to seasonal changes in consumption habits or the availability of fresh produce.","In the later half of the year, the import range of fruit and vegetable juices and frozen fruit in Canada significantly increases. This could be due to the higher demand for these products during the warmer months or the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables that are in season during this time.

From January to April, there is a noticeable decrease in the amount imported. This might be due to seasonal changes or a temporary shift in demand. However, from May to December, the import range increases, reaching its peak in November. This could be attributed to the harvest season, which leads to a higher demand for fresh fruits and vegetables, resulting in increased import of juices and frozen fruit.

There is a notable increase in the value of these imported items from January to December.

In the image, the rushing yards are displayed as a percentage, which is calculated by dividing the actual yardage by the maximum possible yardage. This is done to provide a comparison of the player's performance in relation to the maximum possible performance. Therefore, it is not possible for the rushing yards to be exactly equal to 4000.","Yes, it is possible for a Buffalo Bills player to have rushing yards exactly equal to 4000. This would require a player to have an average of 4 yards per carry and to have carried the ball 1000 times during their career with the Bills. However, this is an improbable scenario, as it would be difficult for a player to consistently achieve such a high average per carry.","Yes, it is possible for a Buffalo Bills player to have rushing yards exactly equal to 4000.

However, it would be unusual and not a typical occurrence for a player to have an exact number of rushing yards.","No, it is not possible for a Buffalo Bills player to have rushing yards exactly equal to 4000. This is due to the fact that a player's rushing yards are typically a multiple of 10, such as 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100.
